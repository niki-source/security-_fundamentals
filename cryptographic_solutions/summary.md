## Cryptographic Solutions Lab

In this lab, I have completed 2 exercises: 
* "Creating and Verifying a Digital Signature"

After completing these exercises, I have learned how to:
* Create a private and public key pair.
* Create a digital signature.
* Receive and verify a digital signature.
* Observe a signature verification failure.
* Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
* Receive and approve a CSR as a Certificate Authority (CA)
