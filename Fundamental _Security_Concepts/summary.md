## What was the Fundamental Security Concepts lab about? 
This lab contained 1 exercise, named "Configuring RAID 1".

* "Configuring RAID 1" * is about creating 2 unformatted virtual hard disks and configuring RAID 1 across the unallocated disks. 

"Configuring RAID 1" ties back to a really important Security+ concept, which is creating storage redundancy.  RAID 1 is a storage method that copies data across 2 or more drives. This ensures redundancy and fault tolerance even if one drive fails. It allows for uninterrupted operation. Configuring RAID 1 is ideal for operating systems, email servers, and situations where data availability is critical. 


To accomplish this task, I made sure to create hard disk partitions and assign them each 5GB of space for the sake of this lab. 

Overall, this lab helped me better understand how RAID 1 provides redundancy and ensures systems remain operational even if a drive fails.
