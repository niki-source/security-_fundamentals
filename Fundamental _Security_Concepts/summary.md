## What was the Fundamental Security Concepts lab about? 
This lab contained 2 exercises, one being "Configuring RAID 1" and the other being "Configure and Test File Integrity Monitoring". 

* "Configuring RAID 1" * is about creating 2 unformatted virtual hard disks and configuring RAID 1 across the unallocated disks. 

* "Configure and Test File Integrity Monitoring" * is about configuring file integrity monitoring and testing it to observe what the logs show when there's 
unexpected changes being made to the files and directory.
